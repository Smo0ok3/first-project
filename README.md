Webpage 

First webpage created from scratch using html and CSS only.
All features are basic and i am using css flexbox tool to arrange the page. 

Hints: i need to revise the html layout - too much useless code and classes without use
- better css code structure - i need to structure the code in an easy way so i can understand when i look back at it.
